ABC:   21 30
Perry: 27 40

* not CNLSY anymore, only PSID and NLSY
* Do the crosswalk between Perry and ABC 
* labor income, parental income (code might be clear)
* We should be thinking about the crime projections 
	(crime might be obscure, might need to write from scratch)
* Appendix, projections.	
* except for the health part.

* We rely on auxiliary data to predict the costs and benefits of the program
  over the life cycle after the measurement phase of the study ends. 
* Only valid predictions of "difference" between out-of-sample treatment and control
  profiles is required. 
  => However, we focus on making valid predictions of separate treatment and control 
     post-a* profiles.
* Exogeneity between error term and X|B needs to be satisfied in order to match
  individuals => How can I check we have exogeneity?
* Stanford Binet, PPVT, CAT, WISC
  
* si30y_inc_trans_pub = rowtotal 

* Synthetic control?
	- The synthetic control method allows for effect estimation in setting where a single unit (a state, 
	  country, firm, etc.) is exposed to an event or intervention. It provides a data-driven procedure
	  to construct synthetic control units based on a convex combination of comparison units that approximates
	  the characteristics of the unit tht is exposed to the intervention. A combination of comparison units 
	  often provides a better comparison for the unit exposed to the intervention than any comparison unit alone. 
	  
	  
* ABC/CARE (Appendix p. 72)
	(i) We use the CNLSY to predict from ages 21 to 29; and
	(ii) We use the NLSY79 and PSID to predict from ages 29 to 79.
	Whenever using the NLSY79 and PSID together, we combine them and use them as a joint sample. 
	
PIAT: The Peabody Individual Achievement Test is a wide-range measure of academic achievement for
      children aged five and over. It is among the most widely used brief assessment of academic
	  achievement with high test-retest reliability and concurrent validity.
